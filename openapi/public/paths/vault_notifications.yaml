            * classes: (required) Array of arXiv categories and sub-categories to include in notifications

            * data: (optional) Formatted search terms to search for within designated classes. If included,
              notifications will include all papers that match the given categories, and papers that match
              the search terms in this data keyword will be highlighted.

          * authors: Meant for weekly frequency; notify the user of up to 5 new papers about given authors.
          Requires the data keyword:

            * data: (required) Must be formatted as `author:\"Last, First\"` or `orcid:\"ORCID-ID\"`. Can
