  summary: Search using bigquery
  description: >
    Search endpoint which accepts a list of many IDs (bibcodes). Supports
    paging.


    This endpoint accepts standard search query parameters and returns standard
    search results, but it also accepts as input a very large query (i.e. a
    query that can be expressed only as a list of search criteria, typically
    IDs). There is currently no limit to the size of the submitted data (besides
    buffer/time limits imposed by our API frontend); however, there are severe
    limits on how often you can call this endpoint. Typically, only 100 requests
    per day per user are allowed.


    The `bigquery` is always executed as a filter **after** the main query (to
    filter out unwanted results and keep only the results specified by the
    `bigquery`). You may want to use `q=*:*` to filter contents of the whole
    database, however it is advisable to make the `q` as specific as possible.
    Broad queries have higher `qTime` (execution time) and that will be counted
    towards your rate-limit (in the future).


    The bigquery filter is *applied only after* the main search (i.e. it limits
    results of the main search).


    ## Example requests


    Python


    ```
      import requests
      bibcodes="bibcode\n1907AN....174...59.\n1908PA.....16..445.\n1989LNP...334..242S"
      r = requests.post('https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/bigquery',
           params={'q':'*:*', 'wt':'json', 'fq':'{!bitset}', 'fl':'bibcode'},
           headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer:TOKEN'},
           data=bibcodes)
    ```


    Bash curl


    ```
      curl 'https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/bigquery?q=*:*&fl=bibcode' \
      -X 'POST' -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' -H 'Content-Type: big-query/csv' \
      -d $'bibcode\n1907AN....174...59.\n1908PA.....16..445.\n1989LNP...334..242S'
    ```

  requestBody:
    description: >
      Newline separated list of values; the first line specifies the index
      field, the rest are the search values. <br/> Currently, we allow searching
      in `bibcode` index only. You can submit `canonical` as well as `alternate`
      bibcodes - the search will automatically match both. In the future, the
      list of available indexes may be extended.


      Note: to correctly format the POST payload, including the newline (\n)
      characters, in a bash curl request, use ANSI-C quoting (e.g. `$'...'`) as
      shown in the examples.
