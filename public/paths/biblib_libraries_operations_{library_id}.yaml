    Perform set operations on one or more libraries. The library_id (string) is
    the unique identifier of the primary library, as specified in the /libraries
    GET response. Depending on the operation, a secondary library ID may need to
    be passed in the post payload.

    ## Examples

    **Union**: take the union of 3 libraries, using the default description and
    public settings

    ``` bash
      $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/biblib/libraries/operations/iRZhyhvaSWe0uWwcXKt77w \
        -X POST \
        -d '{"action": "union", "libraries": ["rdRs4g4AQ522k9TJ2umtVA", "s56fjycaRMKxw6tDEr31XQ"], "name": "New union library"}'
    ```
