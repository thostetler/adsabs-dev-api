  summary: Given some input metadata, return the matched bibcode
  description: >
    Matches input metadata to an existing record and returns the bibcode of the
    match. Can be used to find the bibcode of an input record or to match
    various versions of the same record (e.g. the published paper with its arXiv
    version). Also returned is the confidence score and which input metadata
    fields were used in the matching.

                Set flag to true if you know ADS must have this paper; in some
                cases, the main matching algorithm may fail to find a match
                (e.g. if the abstract has changed significantly between the
                arXiv and published version). If this is the case, setting this
                flag to true allows a match to be made based on the title alone.

              The nucleus of our nearest, large galactic neighbour, M31,
              contains an eccentric nuclear disc - a disc of stars on eccentric,
              apsidally aligned orbits around a supermassive black hole (SMBH).
              Previous studies of eccentric nuclear discs considered only an
              isolated disc, and did not study their dynamics under galaxy
              mergers (particularly a perturbing SMBH). Here, we present the
              first study of how eccentric discs are affected by a galactic
              merger. We perform N-body simulations to study the disc under a
              range of different possible SMBH initial conditions. A second SMBH
              in the disc always disrupts it, but more distant SMBHs can shut
              off differential precession and stabilize the disc. This results
              in a more aligned disc, nearly uniform eccentricity profile, and
              suppression of tidal disruption events compared to the isolated
              disc. We also discuss implications of our work for the presence of
              a secondary SMBH in M31.

        Note: If no matches are found, the service still returns a 200, but
        instead of the "match" keyword, the "no match" keyword will be returned
        in the JSON.
