    For a given bibstem, provide a tally of reference sources for each volume
    for which references exist.  For a publication with references supplied by
    the publisher for most or all papers, the `publisher` count should
    approximately match the paper count for that volume.  References may also
    originate from other sources for individual papers, such as author-supplied
    (e.g. ArXiv) preprints and OCR by NASA ADS.
