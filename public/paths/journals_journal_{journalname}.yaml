    Indexed journals that match a user-supplied search string
  description: >
    For a user-supplied search string, return a list of publication titles and
    their accompanying bibstems, if the search string matches one of the title's
    official name, translated or transliterated names, or a known alternate
    title or abbreviation.  Spaces ("%20" in URL-encoded format) are treated as
    substring terminators, such that the returned result of a search for
    `Astro%20Jour` would include both `Astronomical Journal` and `Astrophysical
    Journal`.
